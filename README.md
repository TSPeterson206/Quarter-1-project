# Welcome to MyRecovery

This is a way to take pride in your recovery and to hold yourself accountable to your loved ones. This page will allow you to tabulate the amount of sober time that you have accrued in minutes, hours and days. Select the tabulation that you want to get by selecting a date from any of the three corresponding calendars.

You can log-in via the 'Log In' button next to the top banner to receive a personal greeting by your progress bars. 

Feel free to add a goal via pressing on any of the numbered buttons on the right-middle portion of the page. Your goal info will populate in one of the Goal Tracker boxes. Once you submit your goal, the progress bar that corresponds with the box will begin. It will display the elapsed time percentage between when you pledged to start and when you pledged to finish. 

Your goal will remain even when you leave the page and return! Enjoy!
